### New Schema

1. Create a new document schema under /schemas/newName.js
2. Add the newly created document schema under /schemas/schema.js
3. Make sure to add it to hiddenFiles from deskStructure/index.js since we are using our own scheme desk structure
4. add new deskstructure under /deskStructure/ -> file name
5. add it under /deskStructure/index.js

### components

If you have a sanity view (S.view).component on deskStructure, this is where we place our react components.
